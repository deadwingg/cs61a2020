* You need a runnable copy of the solutions along with tester.scm

Here is how you would use it:

First, load the student's solution. Then, load the tester file.
After this....

STk> (record-session 'step-test)
Recording session step-test
? to blah
-> print 2
-> print 3
-> end
? blah
2
3
? step "blah
? blah
print 2>>>
2
print 3>>>
3
? unstep "blah
? blah
2
3
?
? bye
Session recorded under name step-test
okay

;; BYE ends the session. tester.scm adds BYE as a primitive and redefines
;; driver-loop

To run a saved test, you use run-test:

STk> (run-test 'step-test)
? to blah
-> print 2
-> print 3
-> end
? blah
2
3
? step "blah
? blah
print 2>>>
2
print 3>>>
3
? unstep "blah
? blah
2
3
?
#t

Now, you can record many sessions (each testing a different thing), and
save them to a file:

STk> (save-tests "my-tests")
okay

And of course now you can load the tests whenever you want and run them.

So if your tests are in "my-tests", and you want to run them on a
student's logo project:

STk> (load "tester")
okay
STk> (rat-file "my-tests")  ;; rat = run all tests
Running test ____
...

Running test ____
...


...
Passed ___ of  ___ tests
okay

This will save you the trouble of typing in all the tests again and again.
But of course you, need to look at the transcripts to make sure it didn't
fail because of the student not outputting exactly the same messages (or
if the student puts in debugs)


One set of tests have been recorded in the file "part2-tests", but 
these are not complete.
